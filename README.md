challenges

-while doing this project most of the conceptes and stratagies are new so we had to explore them before using so that is one of the challenges
-there were a lot of debugging in the process of making this project as an other major challenge
-since this project was done with other projects a little of time limitation was also a challange

used AI fearues

-deepseek- to guide how the project flows and explain codes for us
-gemini - to debug some issues on the code and learn from them
